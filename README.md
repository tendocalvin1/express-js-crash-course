Express.js Beginner Guide
Introduction
Welcome to the Express.js Beginner Guide! This document is designed for newcomers to web development who want to learn about Express.js, a fast, unopinionated, and minimalist web framework for Node.js. Express.js simplifies the process of building robust server-side applications and APIs, making it an excellent choice for beginners and experienced developers alike. This README provides an overview of Express.js, its core features, setup instructions, and a simple example to help you get started.
What is Express.js?
Express.js is a lightweight and flexible Node.js framework that provides a simple way to handle HTTP requests, create RESTful APIs, and build dynamic web applications. It is widely used in the industry due to its scalability, performance, and extensive ecosystem of middleware and plugins.
Key Features

Routing: Define routes to handle HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) with ease.
Middleware: Use modular middleware functions to process requests, handle authentication, logging, and more.
Template Engines: Integrate with template engines like Pug or EJS for dynamic HTML rendering.
Scalability: Build everything from small APIs to large-scale applications with a modular structure.
Community & Ecosystem: Access a vast library of middleware and packages via npm to extend functionality.

Why Learn Express.js?

Industry Standard: Express.js powers many production applications and is a sought-after skill in web development roles.
Node.js Integration: Leverages the power of Node.js for non-blocking, event-driven applications.
Beginner-Friendly: Simple syntax and clear documentation make it approachable for new developers.
Versatility: Suitable for building APIs, web servers, or full-stack applications with frameworks like React or Angular.

Prerequisites
To follow along with this guide, you should have:

Basic knowledge of JavaScript (ES6+).
Node.js and npm installed on your machine (download from nodejs.org).
A code editor like Visual Studio Code.
Familiarity with HTTP methods and REST concepts is helpful but not required.

Getting Started
Installation

Install Node.js and npm: Ensure Node.js is installed by running node -v and npm -v in your terminal.
Create a Project Directory:mkdir my-express-app
cd my-express-app


Initialize a Node.js Project:npm init -y


Install Express.js:npm install express



Your First Express Application
Below is a simple Express.js application to create a server that responds with "Hello, World!" on the root route.

const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

// Define a basic routeapp.get('/', (req, res) => {  res.send('Hello, World!');});
// Start the serverapp.listen(port, () => {  console.log(Server running at http://localhost:${port});});
